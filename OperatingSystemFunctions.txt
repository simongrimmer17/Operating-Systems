An operating system is necesary for a system to power on.
When the power button is pressed, the computer recieves a signal to begin the process of starting up.
During this process, the operating system runs a series of checks to make sure that key components of the computer are there, both hardware and software.
If these tests are successful, the computer begins running the steps to boot the system.
